dreamlog.sh
a simple dream log management system in bash
by tony baldwin - www.tonybaldwin.me

INSTALLATION:
I keep this in ~/bin/dreamlog, but stick it anywhere in your path.
Make a director in your $HOME, ~/.dreamlog

HOW TO USE DREAMLOG:

dreamlog - opens a new dreamlog file to edit in vim.
dreamlog r - reads all entries (cats all files in the dir, pipes to less)
dreamlog r yyyymmdd - reads entries from date yyyymmdd. One can specify just yyyymm, or just yyyy, even.
dreamlog l - lists all dreamlog entries. Like r, it can be narrowed down with date parameters.
dreamlog s searchterm - searches for searchterm in dream entries.
dreamlog h - displays this help message.

Yes. If you like, you can change "vim" to your preferred editor.
